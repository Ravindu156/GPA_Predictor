# GPA Predictor Projects

This repository contains two distinct GPA Predictor applications developed using Python and Tkinter. Each project uses a different approach to predict the GPA for the third semester based on various personal and academic factors.

## Projects Overview

1. **GPA Predictor with Algorithm (Linear Model)**:
   - Utilizes a simple linear regression model for GPA prediction.
   - Includes a GUI for user interaction built with Tkinter.
   - Predicts the GPA based on the GPA of the first two semesters and other influencing factors.

2. **GPA Predictor with Machine Learning (Random Forest)**:
   - Utilizes a Random Forest Regressor for more complex and accurate GPA prediction.
   - Includes a GUI for user interaction built with Tkinter.
   - Predicts the GPA based on the GPA of the first two semesters and other influencing factors using a trained model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn (for the Random Forest project)
- tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
